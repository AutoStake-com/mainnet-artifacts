# Aura Network Validator Pledge

As the Aura foundation delegation receiver, The Silver Fox pledges to meet the following works. If, for any reason, we do not meet these commitments then we understand that we may lose delegation staked to us.

    1. Top 25 validators must run an Euphoria testnet node beside Xstaxy mainnet node
    2. The hardware for mainnet meets the recommended baseline    
    3. Uptime of at least 90%
    4. Commission rate is between 3% and 5% (Currently at 5%)
    5. Commit to participate in network governance at least 2/3 of the total proposals throughout the delegation period
    6. Must set Gas Price >= 0.001 uaura
    7. Publicly announced to the social channels on the delegation decision
    8. Commit to network contributions listed below: 
    Category 1: Infrastructure
     - Providing a Testnet node
    Category 2: Software engineering
     - As I am going through my journey of learning Javascript, GO and RUST are on my list to learn.  I've already provided some code contributions to other chains but they are very small.
	 - Help support node runners
	 - *Completed* Created Unbonding stats with charts.  https://thesilverfox.pro/#blockchains Click on Aura's Icon and wait for data to load.
		- Working on providing more data like:
			- Top 10 total unbonds from Validators
			- Top Unbonding Wallets
			- Hourly & Daily total staked amounts
				- Per validator
				- Top wallets
				- Validators adding self bonds
	 - Nearly complete Upgrade Script offered as a complete package to replace Cosmosvisor.
		- Might like some help getting a separate testnet going where I can test the script by issuing upgrade props to fully simulate the process.
    Category 3: Community growth
     - I am still working on an extensive Documentation site. *This is taking quite a bit of time*
	 - I retweet/quote tweet most announcements.
    Category 4: Business development
     - Being avaliable for Aura when needs arise
	 - I still have every intention of writing the math paper on the DEX formula
